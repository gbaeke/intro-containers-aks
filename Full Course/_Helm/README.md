# Helm

## Installing Helm

Install Helm from https://github.com/helm/helm/releases or use an installer like Chocolatey or brew. E.g., `brew install helm`

Run `helm version` to check the installed version.

## Installing charts


### Basics: installing and uninstalling a chart from a repo

Charts are installed from repositories or directly from the filesystem. A chart repository is just a web server with packaged charts and an `index.yaml` file.

See https://github.com/gbaeke/helm-chart which is available via GitHub pages as https://gbaeke.github.io/helm-chart/. When you open that page in the browser, you will see installations instructions.

To add the super api application from the super-api chart repository, first add the repository:

```
helm repo add super-api https://gbaeke.github.io/helm-chart/
```

Above, the name `super-api` is arbitrary. You can use any name you like.

Then install the chart: 

```
helm install super super-api/super-api
```

The name you use after install is arbitrary (it's called the release name). You can use any name you like. The name will be used as part of the deployment and pod names because this chart is configured to include the release name in the deployment and pod names.

After running the above command, check the installation status with the following commands:

```bash
helm ls

# same as ls
helm list

# show all releases in all namespaces
helm list --all-namespaces

# the deployment name will include the release name
kubectl get deploy

kubectl get pods

kubectl get services

kubectl get hpa
```

‚ö†Ô∏è It is important to realise that `helm install` simply uses YAML templates, injects parameters into those YAML templates and then renders a big YAML file that combines all of the YAML files. For example, a Helm chart can include two YAML templates:
- deployment.yaml: defines the deployment (kind: Deployment)
- service.yaml: defines the service (kind: Service)

In the above YAML files, Helm will look for placeholders (ok, it's a bit more advanced than that; you can use all sorts of functions and conditional logic) and replaces the "placeholders" üòâ with parameters that you set. The result is one bigger YAML with a service and a deployment seperated with ---. The bigger YAML file is then submitted to the Kubernetes API server. You can see the YAML when you run `helm template chartname`.

To uninstall the chart, run the following command:

```
helm uninstall super
```

All resources deployed by the chart are removed. `helm ls` will not show the chart anymore.

### Upgrading an installation

Install superapi again with `helm install super super-api/super-api`.

The installation uses version 1.0.3 of the `ghcr.io/gbaeke/super` image. Let's install a higher version. Because there is no newer chart that installs that version, we will use a parameter to specify the version during the upgrade:

`helm upgrade super super-api/super-api --set image.tag=1.0.4`

Note the use of `helm upgrade` above. The `--set` parameter is used to set a value that will be passed to the chart. The value is used in the deployment that the chart creates in the `spec.template.spec.containers.image` value in the deployment manifest.

If there was a newer version of the chart, we could use:

`helm upgrade super super-api/super-api --version 1.0.1`

Note that 1.0.1 is the **chart version**, not the image version. But that chart version could use a different image version as default, for instance 1.0.4.

To see the installation history, use `helm history super`. The result could be:

```
REVISION        UPDATED                         STATUS          CHART           APP VERSION     DESCRIPTION
1               Mon Mar 14 18:01:02 2022        superseded      super-api-1.0.0 1.0.3           Install complete
2               Mon Mar 14 18:01:17 2022        deployed        super-api-1.0.0 1.0.3           Upgrade complete
```

Above, there are two revisions. Use `helm get` to obtain information about the revisions:

```
helm get all super --revision=2

helm get manifest super --revision=2

helm get values super --revision=2

helm get values super --revision=1
```

`helm get` returns results for the most recent revision. You can set the revision with the `--revision` parameter.

The release information is stored in secrets of type helm.sh/release.v1. Use `kubectl get secrets` to see the secrets. There is one secret per revision.

### Rolling back

To roll back to a previous revision, use:

```
helm rollback super 1
```

The command `helm hist super` now shows:

```
REVISION        UPDATED                         STATUS          CHART           APP VERSION     DESCRIPTION
1               Mon Mar 14 18:01:02 2022        superseded      super-api-1.0.0 1.0.3           Install complete
2               Mon Mar 14 18:01:17 2022        superseded      super-api-1.0.0 1.0.3           Upgrade complete
3               Mon Mar 14 18:14:16 2022        deployed        super-api-1.0.0 1.0.3           Rollback to 1
```

Note: when you uninstall a chart, you can keep the history with `helm uninstall super --keep-history`.

Note: in practice, when you use pipelines to deploy a chart, you will not want to use `helm rollback`. Instead, you will use `helm upgrade` to install the chart with correctely configured parameters or other changes.

### Dry run and template

Use dry run to see what the install/upgrade would do without actually performing the installation or upgrade. For example:

```
helm upgrade --install super super-api/super-api --set image.tag=1.0.4 --dry-run
```

The output is not YAML you can apply to your cluster because it includes metadata at the top and a NOTES.txt file with instructions.

To obtain a template you can submit to Kubernetes, use the following:

```
helm template super super-api/super-api
```

Note: `--dry-run` contacts the Kubernetes API, but does not perform the installation or upgrade. If you chart limits installation to specific Kubernetes versions or templates retrieve Kubernetes information such as major and minor versions, the result of dry run will indicate that. `helm template` does not contact the Kubernetes API so the results might be different from `--dry-run`.

### Using --wait

To wait until the deployment is ready and healthy, use:

```
helm upgrade --install super super-api/super-api --set image.tag=1.0.4 --wait
```

Note: it is recommended to use `--wait` in pipelines to know if the installation was successful. You should also increase the timeout with the `--timeout` parameter.

## Creating a chart

Create a chart with `helm create CHARTNAME`. This will create a directory with a chart.yaml file, a values.yaml file and a templates directory.

The directory structure is the chart. You can install a chart directly from the file system. If you are in a folder that contains a chart called `superapi` (the result of `helm create superapi`), you can install it with:

```
helm install super superapi
```

Above, `superapi` would be the folder containing the chart.yaml file. You can of course use `helm install super .` if you are in that folder.

‚ö†Ô∏è In a pipeline, you can simply install a chart directly from the cloned repository. You do not have to store your Helm chart in a repository.

‚ö†Ô∏è The chart created by `helm create` creates a sample chart that installs nginx, which is a good starting point for many charts. Helm supports other starters. See https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/#chart-starter-packs for more information.

## Changing Chart.yaml

Below is the Chart.yaml file for the superapi chart with added properties:

```yaml
apiVersion: v2
name: super-api
version: 1.0.0
description: A Helm chart for super-api

type: application

appVersion: "1.0.3"

keywords:
  - api
  - super-api
  - golang

home: https://github.com/gbaeke/super-api
sources: 
  - https://github.com/gbaeke/super-api

maintainers:
  - name: gbaeke
    email: me@example.com
```

Not all properties are required. The most important properties are:
- apiVersion: Helm 3 uses the v2 API version
- name: the name of the chart
- version: the version of the chart; if there are multiple versions in a repository, you can specify the version to install with --version
- appVersion: the version of the application you are installing; the value of appVersion is used by the default `values.yaml` file to determine the tag of the container image
- type: application; the other option is `library` which should be used to provide templates to other application charts; a chart that installs an application in Kubernetes is always an application chart

### Changing values.yaml

The `values.yaml` file is optional. It is used to specify the default values for the chart. Those values are used in templates to render the final YAML that the chart will install. Although it is not required to have all the values you can use in templates in values.yaml, it is recommended to do so.

In the sample values.yaml, you will see the following first 5 lines:

```yaml
# Default values for super-api.
# This is a YAML-formatted file.
# Declare variables to be passed into your templates.

replicaCount: 1
```

Above, the value of `replicaCount` is 1. It is used in the `deployment.yaml` template to create a deployment with 1 replica. The `deployment.yaml` file is in the `templates` directory. `replicaCount` is referenced as follows (last line):

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: {{ include "super-api.fullname" . }}
  labels:
    {{- include "super-api.labels" . | nindent 4 }}
spec:
  {{- if not .Values.autoscaling.enabled }}
  replicas: {{ .Values.replicaCount }}
```

Above, {{ .Values.replicaCount}} will be replaced by `1` when you run `helm install install-name chart-name`. Helm uses the Go template syntax. To override the value of `replicaCount`, you can use the `--set` parameter: `helm install install-name chart-name --set replicaCount=2`. But even if replicaCount is not in values.yaml, you can use it with `--set`.

In values.yaml, make the following changes:
- set replicaCount to 2
- set image.repository to ghcr.io/gbaeke/super
  - the container registry is ghcr.io (GitHub Container Registry)
  - the repository is gbaeke/super; it is a namespaced repository name with the GitHub user name as the namespace; this is similar to Docker Hub
- remove {} behind `securityContext` and uncomment the commented YAML under it
  - {} would indicate an empty block
- do the same for `resources`
- enable `autoscaling` (enabled: true) and set min and max replicas to 1 and 5 respectively
  - when autoscaling is enabled, `spec.replicaset` is not rendered in the deployment.yaml (using an if statement)

In `deployment.yaml`, make the following changes:
- set `containerPort` to 8080 (there is no value for it in the sample)
- livenessProbe should use /healthz endpoint
- readinessProbe should use /readyz endpoint

**Note**: instead of modifying the containerPort value, you could add a value for it in values.yaml and reference it in the deployment.yaml.

### Running `helm template`

Run `helm template .` from the folder that contains the chart to see the template that will be used to install the chart. Does it render well? Make an error in deployment.yaml and try again.

### Using dry-run

The `helm template` command does not contact the Kubernetes API server. When you do a dry run, the Kubernetes API server is contacted. We can check this by adding the following line to Chart.yaml:

```
kubeVersion: ">= 1.23.0"
```

The line above requires Kubernetes version 1.23.0. The chart will not install if the version is lower.

Now run `helm install super . --dry-run`. This should fail with the following warning if you are **NOT** running Kubernetes 1.23 or later:

```
Error: INSTALLATION FAILED: chart requires kubeVersion: >= 1.23.0 which is incompatible with Kubernetes v1.21.9
```

## Templating

### Templates

Templates are used in YAML manifests in the `templates` directory. This is a convention, not a requirement. Below is an example of a template:

```
plane: {{ .Values.plane | default "Airbus" | quote }}  
```

The template is similar to a Linux pipeline:
- grab the plane value from the values.yaml file
- when there is no plane value, set it to "Airbus"
- quote the value (put "" around the value)

### Named templates

You can define and name templates to reuse them in other templates. For example, `deployment.yaml` begins with the following:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: {{ include "super-api.fullname" . }}
  labels:
    {{- include "super-api.labels" . | nindent 4 }}
```

In metadata, the name field is a template that references another template called `super-api.fullname`. In this case, the `super-api.fullname` template is defined in `_helpers.tpl`. It is defined as follows:

```yaml
{{- define "super-api.fullname" -}}
{{- if .Values.fullnameOverride }}
{{- .Values.fullnameOverride | trunc 63 | trimSuffix "-" }}
{{- else }}
{{- $name := default .Chart.Name .Values.nameOverride }}
{{- if contains $name .Release.Name }}
{{- .Release.Name | trunc 63 | trimSuffix "-" }}
{{- else }}
{{- printf "%s-%s" .Release.Name $name | trunc 63 | trimSuffix "-" }}
{{- end }}
{{- end }}
{{- end }}
```

What this does exactly is not too important. The template uses many of the Golang templating features such as if statements, variables, and so on. The template results in a name for your deployment.

### Using data from values.yaml and Chart.yaml

To grab data from these files, use `.Values.XYZ` or `.Chart.XYZ`. An example would be:
- {{ .Values.image.repository }}
- {{ .Chart.AppVersion }}

In `deployment.yaml`, the `image.repository` field is a template that references `.Values.image.repository`:

```yaml
image: "{{ .Values.image.repository }}:{{ .Values.image.tag | default .Chart.AppVersion }}"
```

The references to Values and Chart start with a . (dot). This . (dot) object is passed by Helm to your templates before rendering. The dot object contains:
- Values: the values.yaml file (.Values.someKeyYouChoose)
- Chart: the Chart.yaml file (.Chart.Name, .Chart.Version, ...)
- Release: release information like .Release.Name
- Capabilities: used to query the Kubernetes API server for capabilities such as .Capabilities.KubeVersion.Major
- Files: work with files in your template

### Conditional logic

Simple `if` statement:

```yaml
{{- if not .Values.autoscaling.enabled }}
replicas: {{ .Values.replicaCount }}
{{- end }}
```

Use `with` to do the same but also replace the . object:

```yaml
    {{- with .Values.podAnnotations }}
      annotations:
        {{- toYaml . | nindent 8 }}
    {{- end }}
```

Above you check if .Values.podAnnotations is defined and if so, print it as YAML. The . object now only contains the podAnnotations, not the entire . object. It is necessary to convert . to YAML with the toYaml function and indent the YAML properly!
